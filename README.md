# TicketBright - SOEN341 Project F25

## About

### Project Overview

This project is a Campus Events & Ticketing Web Application designed to help students browse, register for and attend events on campus.

1. Students browse events, save them, claim tickets, and check in using QR codes.

2. Organizers create and manage events, track attendance, and analyze engagement.

3. Administrators moderate content, oversee organizations, and access global statistics.

The project follows the Agile Scrum methodology and is divided into four sprints. Each sprint delivers incremental features, documentation, and working prototypes.

The goal is to produce a middle-fidelity prototype that demonstrates core functionality and could serve as the foundation for a real-world application. Do note that this project is for educational purposes and is part of a university assignment, not intended for commercial or practical use.
